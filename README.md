# Mobpression
Inspired by [MergedMob](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/mergedmob.11399/) for Spigot

### What is it?
Have you ever wanted to have a way of easily managing your mobs into one small area automatically? Or perhaps optimise the amount of entities on your server? Well now you can!

**Mobpression** makes the life of any server owner easy by compressing all of your like-mobs together. Compressed mobs can stack on top of each-other to create a larger compression and you can kill a compressed mob to decrement the amount of mobs left! 

### How do I use it?
1. Drop the plugin jar file into your `/mods` or `/plugins` folder.
2. Launch your server and that's it!

### What's to come in the future?
Currently, the plugin is in a working state, but there are improvements that I plan to make in the future.
- Allow you to blacklist the compression of certain mobs using a list in the config. 
- Add a configurable layout for the name of the compressed mob shown. Default: **[**2x**]**
- Optimise the way that compressed mobs compress with eachother.
- Add a management system which will allow you to remove/spawn compressed mobs in the world.

**You'll notice that it takes effect right away! There is no configuration needed as of yet.**
